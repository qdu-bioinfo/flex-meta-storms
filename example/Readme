#Here we provide a demo dataset of 136 real microbiome samples in 2 different Groups.
#The source data is from NCBI database, and the project number is PRJNA644520.
#
#File description
#dataset.abd: OTUs picked by Parallel-Meta Suite against Greengenes v13-8 (OTUs simulated by Greengenes v13-8).
#dataset.meta: metadata of the samples.
#
#To run the demo, you can either 
#
#sh Readme
#
#or
#type the following commands. 
#
#Commands:
#Biomarker selection for samples
PM_Marker_Test.R -m dataset.meta -i dataset.abd -o Marker
#
#Calculate the Flex Meta-Storms (FMS) distance of the samples
FMS-comp-taxa -T dataset.abd -M ./Marker/Out.Group.sig.meanTests.xls -o target.dist
#
#Calculate the Meta-Storms distance on exact markers of the samples
FMS-comp-taxa -T dataset.abd -M ./Marker/Out.Group.sig.meanTests.xls -k -o exact.dist
#
#Output description
#target.dist: Regular pairwise Flex Meta-Storms distance of 136 samples
#target.dist.target_marker: Relative abundance of target members in 136 samples
#exact.dist: Regular pairwise Meta-Storms distance on exact markers of 136 samples
#exact.dist.exact_marker: Relative abundance of exact markers in 136 samples
#This demo run should take less than 5 minute on a recommended computer.
